# BikeNexus-backend
 An API for motorcycle models and specs. This API was made using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and flask-restful.

# Project structure
 Being a flask project, the app is under the BikeNexus directory. In there, there's a folder to organize future contributions or updates in this project.

# Weekly Projects Program
 This project is the second in a series of 52 projects that I have planned. The goal of this program is to undertake a new project or a part of a larger project every week. Each project will focus on different technologies that I'm interested in and want to learn more about.

 Stay tuned for more exciting projects in the coming weeks!
